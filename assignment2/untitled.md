# Please Readme First

## Issues
When working with IPython.display, we found a issue: a single HTML file `Assignment2.html` cannot embed numerous IFrames efficiently. This constraint impacted our ability to display all plots within a single HTML document.

## Solution
After executing Assignment2.ipynb, We divided Assignment2.ipynb into two separate Jupyter Notebook files.

## Viewing the Assignment
The two generated HTML files serve as a sequential representation of the complete assignment. They are designed to be viewed directly and will provide a cohesive understanding of the assignment's contents.

## Source File
Please note that the primary source file for the assignment is `Assignment2.ipynb`. The two subdivided files are derivatives created for display purposes only. If there's a need to verify or investigate any aspect of the assignment, please refer directly to the `Assignment2.ipynb` file.
