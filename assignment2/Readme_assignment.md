# Please Readme First

## Issues
When working with IPython.display, we found a issue: a single HTML file `Assignment2.html` cannot embed numerous IFrames efficiently. This constraint stops us displaying all plots within a single HTML document.

## Solution
After executing Assignment2.ipynb, We divided Assignment2.ipynb into 3 separate Jupyter Notebook files and HTML files.

## Viewing the Assignment
The 3 generated HTML files `Assigment2-*.html` serve as a sequential representation of the complete assignment. They are designed to be viewed directly and will provide a cohesive understanding of the assignment's contents. Please ignore the `Assigment2.html` if it does not work on your browser.

## Source File
Please note that the primary source file for the assignment is `Assignment2.ipynb`. The 3 subdivided files are created for display purposes only. If there's a need to verify or investigate any aspect of the assignment, please directly run the `Assignment2.ipynb` file.

## Still Don't Work?
If plots still do not display correctly, you can locate the corresponding HTML files in the `htmls` folder for viewing.
